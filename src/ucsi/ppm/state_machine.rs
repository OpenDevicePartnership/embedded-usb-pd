//! This module defines the core PPM state machine as defined in 6.1 of the UCSI spec.
//! <https://www.usb.org/document-library/usb-type-cr-connector-system-software-interface-ucsi-specification>
//!
//! The state machine presented in the spec is a combination of state (circular boxes) as well as
//! actions (rectangular boxes) that should be done when transitioning between states. How to perform these actions
//! is left to the implementation. The state machine presented here abstracts over these actions with the [`Input`] enum.
//! The [`Output`] enum defines the notifications to the OPM.

/// PPM states
///
/// The spec does not explicitly distinguish between the Busy(false) and Busy(true) states. But this is done here
/// because otherwise it would allow to transition from the Idle(false) state to the Idle(true) state without
/// notifications being enabled.
