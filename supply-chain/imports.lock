Security review of earlier versions of the crate can be found at
(Google-internal, sorry): go/image-crate-chromium-security-review

The crate exposes a function marked as `unsafe`, but doesn't use any
`unsafe` blocks (except for tests of the single `unsafe` function).  I
think this justifies marking this crate as `ub-risk-1`.

Additional review comments can be found at https://crrev.com/c/4723145/31

Inheriting ub-risk-1 from the baseline review of 1.13.0. While the delta has some diffs in unsafe code, they are either:
- migrating code to use helper macros
- migrating match patterns to take advantage of default bindings mode from RFC 2005
Either way, the result is code that does exactly the same thing and does not change the risk of UB.

All two functions from the public API of this crate use `unsafe` to avoid bound
checks for an array access.  Cross-module analysis shows that the offsets can
be statically proven to be within array bounds.  More details can be found in
the unsafe review CL at https://crrev.com/c/5350386.

This crate has been added to Chromium in https://crrev.com/c/3891618.
